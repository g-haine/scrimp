# Changelog

Changes to SCRIMP are recorded here. See also the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/g-haine/scrimp/releases).

## 1.2.0 — 2026-11-12

### Added

- **Global scalar (lumped) ports** through `DPHS.add_lumped_port()`:
  finite-dimensional state, co-state and algebraic variables with exactly
  one degree of freedom, independent of mesh resolution.
- Support for assembling coupled distributed PDE and global ODE weak-form
  contributions, with GetFEM variables synchronized to PETSc Newton
  trial iterates.
- Two new runnable, documented port-Hamiltonian ODE examples:
  `examples/mass_spring_damper.py` and
  `examples/nonlinear_pendulum.py`.
- `docs/source/lumped.rst` and worked Sphinx pages explaining the
  formulation, implementation and validation of the new examples.
- An **experimental** viscous shallow-water / moving-tank PDE–ODE
  prototype in `sandbox/sloshing_tank.py`, plus convergence diagnostics
  in `sandbox/tank_convergence.py`.

### Changed

- Corrected the nonlinear implicit residual assembly path for lumped
  systems having **linear time-derivative mass matrices**.
- Standardized the SCRIMP copyright/license header in tracked Python
  sources and the GUI code-generation template.
- Updated the test suite to use the currently supported public API,
  rather than removed symbolic/schema modules.
- Updated the package and documentation version to **1.2.0**.
- Adopted the standard setuptools PEP 517 build backend with
  `pyproject.toml`, retaining `setup.py` for package metadata.
- Used the root project README for the package's long description.

### Validation

- Python syntax check passed, excluding generated `outputs/` data.
- Full unit-test discovery: **57 tests passed**.
- Full default runs of both new finite-dimensional examples passed.
- Existing `examples/wave.py` completed: **501 steps**, no rejected
  steps and no nonlinear solver failures; Hamiltonian and boundary
  powers computed.
- Sphinx HTML and LaTeX built with `-W` and no warnings;
  the documentation PDF contains **100 pages**.
- The distribution wheel was built successfully. After the final
  README metadata correction, rebuild the wheel once more before
  tagging.

### Known limitations

- The sloshing tank remains **experimental**: wall impermeability and
  convergence of spatial fields have not yet been fully validated.
- The corrected nonlinear residual path does **not** address general
  state-dependent nonlinear mass matrices.
- PETSc may report an unused `-isset false` option; some real-valued
  runs emit complex-to-real conversion warnings.
- In the historical wave example, the last monitor entry was
  `t = 5.01` for `t_f = 5.0`; this endpoint discrepancy is not
  addressed in this release.
- Standalone examples have passed runtime checks; quantitative
  time-refinement and energy-balance studies for both new ODE
  examples remain future validation work.

## 1.1.1 — 2024-03-21

- Changed the output-directory behavior to use the current working
  directory.
- Corrected the sign of a source term and improved documentation.
- Added notebooks.
