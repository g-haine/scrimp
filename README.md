# What is [SCRIMP](https://g-haine.github.io/scrimp/)?

**[SCRIMP](https://g-haine.github.io/scrimp/)** (Simulation and ContRol of Interactions in Multi-Physics) is a python collection of methods and classes for the structure-preserving discretization and simulation of multi-physics models, using the formalism of port-Hamiltonian systems ([van der Schaft and Maschke (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0393-0440(01)00083-3)). 

**[SCRIMP](https://g-haine.github.io/scrimp/)** aims at speeding the coding process of the **Partitioned Finite Element Method** on a wide range of (multi-)physical systems ([Brugnoli *et al.* (2021)](https://doi.org/10.4236/jamp.2021.96088)), and scrimp and save time!

The main objective of a **structure-preserving discretization** in the port-Hamiltonian formalism is to obtain a discrete version of the power balance satisfied by the Hamiltonian functional.
